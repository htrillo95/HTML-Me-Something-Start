          <h2>My Projects</h2>
          <p>Even though I'm just starting out, I've already completed several projects to practice my skills. Such as a simple scrabble scorer. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/htrillo95">Link To GitHub</a></li>
            <p>I'm currently in the process of updating my GitHub repository as I progress through LaunchCode's coding program. It's an ongoing endeavor, so please check back periodically for the latest updates and projects.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/htrillo95/Scrabble-Scorer-Autograded/blob/main/scrabble-scorer.js">Scrabble Scorer</a></li>
            <p>An implementation of Scrabble scoring algorithms named Simple Score, Bonus Vowels, and traditional Scrabble scoring. Allows users to input words and calculate scores based on selected algorithms</p>

               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I enjoy learning about new technologies and think solving problems through code is an interesting concept. We use technology daily and it's constantly evolving. I feel as though learning how they work and being able to use them would be useful throughout my professional career. I look forward to continuing my learning journey and honing my skills.</p>
